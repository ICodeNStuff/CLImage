# CLImage improved. I accidentally named it this, because I didnt know this existed. 
Give the program an image by command line and the program will print the colored image in the terminal (using ascii). Supports almost all terminals.

# Use with:
python flow.py    [Image Name]    [Character to print for each pixel. Can be multiple.](default = 'X')    [Quality multiplier (will use more characters, must be an int, zooming in and out almost always required) ](default = 4)
